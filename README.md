# Tome

Tome is a simple text-based format for data interchange. It is designed to be a lightweight alternative to JSON and TOML.

Tome looks similar to TOML but it's more like JSON with some tweaks here and there. All Tome files are objects without exception.

## Current Status

**⚠️ Work In Progress (WIP) / Under Development**
This project is currently under heavy development. Features and syntax may change.

## Features & Syntax

- **Line Comments**: Only supports line comments using the `#` symbol.
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Just like JSON, there are key-value pairs (spaces between equal signs are optional).
- **Unquoted Keys**: Unlike JSON, there are no quotes around keys.
- **Strings**: Enclosed in double quotes. They are multi-line by default. Escaping works just like JSON.
- **Literals**: Supports literal values for numbers and booleans.
- **Arrays**: Supports arrays, which can be nested and multi-line.
- **Objects**: Supports nested objects.

### Example

```tome
# Tome is a simple text-based format for data interchange.
# It only supports line comments by using the `#` symbol. Like this one

# Tome looks similar to TOML but it's more like JSON with some tweaks here and there
# All tome files are objects without exception

# Just like JSON, there are key-value pairs (spaces between equal signs are optional)
# But unlike JSON, there are no quotes around keys
# Strings are enclosed in double quotes
title = "Example file" # comments are supported at the end of the line too

# strings are multi-line by default
multi_line_string = "This is a multi-line string.
It can span multiple lines."

escaped = "This is an escaped string with a backslash: \\" # just like JSON

# Support literal values for numbers and booleans
enabled = true
port = 8080

# Support arrays, which can be nested
array = [1, 2, 3]

# Unlike TOML arrays can be multi-line
array = [
    1,
    2,
    3,
]

# Support objects
object = {key = "value"}

# And a combination of arrays and objects
combination = {
	values: [1, 2, 3]
}
```

## Installation

Since Tome is an Odin library, the best way to use it is to add it to your existing Odin project. You can do this by either:

1. Adding it as a git submodule:
    ```bash
    git submodule add <repository-url> tome
    ```
2. Downloading the source directly and placing it in your project's directory.

Then, you can import it in your Odin code (assuming you placed it in a directory named `tome`):

```odin
import "tome"
```

## Running Tests

To run the test suite for the parser and tokenizer:

```bash
odin test tests
```
